| Defining Classes         | 1. Define your own classes in a programming context.<br>2. Create objects based on classes you've defined.<br>3. Learn how to write a constructor.<br>4. Understand the role of the parameter name `self`.<br>5. Explore what attributes are and how they are utilized. |


#### Part 9 - Objects and Classes
| Section                  | Objectives                                              |

| Objects as Attributes     | 1. Implement the use of objects as attributes in other objects.<br>2. Understand the use of the keyword `None`. |
| Encapsulation            | 1. Grasp the concept of encapsulation in programming.<br>2. Create private attributes.<br>3. Implement `getters` and `setters` for attributes. |
| Scope of Methods          | 1. Control the visibility of methods in Python.<br>2. Implement private methods. |
| Class Attributes          | 1. Understand the terms "class variable" and "class method".<br>2. Differentiate static traits from instance traits.<br>3. Add static traits to your own classes. |


#### Part 10 - Larger Application Development 
| Section                             | Objectives                                                      |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Class Hierarchies                   | - Understand the concept of inheritance in programming contexts.<br>- Write classes that inherit from other classes.<br>- Understand how inheritance affects traits in classes.       |
| Access Modifiers                    | - Understand the concepts of private and protected access modifiers.<br>- Know how visibility of traits is determined in Python.       |
| Object-Oriented Programming         | - Be familiar with different uses for the variable name "self."<br>- Know how to overload operators in your classes.<br>- Be able to create an iterable class. |
| Techniques                          | - Understand basic principles of application development.<br>- Differentiate between parts of an application (user interface, program logic, and file handling).<br>- Practice writing somewhat larger applications. |
